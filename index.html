                <h2>Welcome to FootballTalk.com</h2>
                <p>FootballTalk is for those who have a particular interest in stats. Here, you can find all sorts of information about the best performing teams and players across different leagues.</p>
                <br>
                <p>(As a quick note to the viewer of this submission. Player, League and Club names have been altered to avoid any issues with copyright (I hope this is okay!). This website is a demonstration of what I have learned throughout the course. Statstics and league positions have also been altered. I wanted to take this time to thank you. I've thoroughly enjoyed this introduction to coding and am grateful for this opportunity.)</p>
                <br>
                <p>FootballTalk also has a podcast series. If you're looking for something to listen to that discusses football then why not give our podcast a try!

Or are your questions relating to the current season? Whatever your football questions may be, becoming a member allows you to send them through. So, if you'd like to get involved, listen to our episodes early (including access to some bonus episodes) then sign up now down below!</p>
